Hello, world.

Wow, this has been one heck of a journey. From never having written any iOS/Swift code a few short months ago to having a full scale application completed. I'd like to thank the Apple documentation, you da best. I'd also like to thank my partners in crime: Nick Arnold, for putting in an insane amount of polish work after I had built the core-game logic, and Michael Wayman for *waymifying* our code.

The application is currently going through the review process.

In the mean time, our pre-launch app [website](http://splash.sliderush.com) is up!
