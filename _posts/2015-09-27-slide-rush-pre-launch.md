Hello, world.

Wow, this has been one heck of a journey to get this thing published. I'd like to thank the Apple documentation, you da best. I'd also like to thank my partners in crime: Nick Arnold, for putting in an insane amount of polish work after I had built the core-game logic, and Michael Wayman for *waymifying* our code. I'd like to thank Brittany Smith for her design work, and to everyone else involved along the way, thanks! We couldn't have gotten this far without you!

The application is currently going through the review process.

In the mean time, our pre-launch app [website](http://splash.sliderush.com) is up!
